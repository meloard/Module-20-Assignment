# React Portfolio

## Description

After learning a new front-end technology, React, I created my own personal portfolio page that displays some samples of my work. This project provided excellent experience with navigating through a front-end react app, and laying the different information on a single HTML page. I really enjoyed building a website with react and hope to continue improving my skills by working with it further!
